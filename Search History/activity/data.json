{"content": ["POWER DIODEA power diode is a crystalline semiconductor device used mainly to convertalternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), a process known as rectification.Found in the power supply circuits of virtually all modern-day electrical andelectronic equipment, a power diode's function is akin to a mechanical one-wayvalve. It conducts electric current with minimal resistance in one direction,known as its forward direction, while preventing current from flowing in theopposite direction. Typically capable of passing as much as several hundredamps forward, power diodes have much larger P-N junctions and hence higherforward current carrying capacity than their smaller signal diode relatives usedin consumer electronics to regulate and reduce current. This makes powerdiodes better suited for applications where larger currents and higher voltagesare involved.Small signal diodes can also be used as rectifiers in low-power, low current(less than 1-amp) rectifiers or applications, but where larger forward biascurrents or higher reverse bias blocking voltages are involved the PN junctionof a small signal diode would eventually overheat and melt so larger morerobust Power Diodes are used instead.The power semiconductor diode, known simply as the Power Diode, has a muchlarger PN junction area compared to its smaller signal diode cousin, resulting ina high forward current capability of up to several hundred amps (KA) and areverse blocking voltage of up to several thousand volts (KV).Since the power diode has a large PN junction, it is not suitable for highfrequency applications above 1MHz, but special and expensive high frequency,high current diodes are available. For high frequency rectifier applicationsSchottky Diodes are generally used because of their short reverse recoverytime and low voltage drop in their forward bias condition.Bibliographyhttps://www.mepits.com/tutorial/439/active-component/diode-typeswww.d.umn.edu/~sburns/.../Power%20Diodes%20Nascene%20and%20Clifton.pptxhttps://www.quora.com/What-is-a-power-diode"], "time": ["Searched for\u00a0", "Aug 15, 2018, 9:15:53 AM UTC"]},
